# Aquarium

Hello and welcome to Aquarium! Aquarium consists of a monorepo in which I have implemented an application using three distinct technologies.

## Features of the application

Aquarium consists of a window in which a white dot (the 'fish'), moves around the window at random. The path the fish takes is determined through randomly generating, from the position the fish is currently at, a quadratic Bézier curve that indicate the path and destination the fish will take.

## Technologies used

This application has been developed in three distinct technologies:

- Go
- C++ with SFML (credit to https://github.com/SFML/cmake-sfml-project for their template)
- JavaScript (not yet released as of now)
